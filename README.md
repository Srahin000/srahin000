### 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Sadman Rahin**, a rising junior studying Computer Science at **The City College of New York**.  

🔬 I’m currently:
- 🛩️ **AI/ML Engineering Intern at the Air Force Research Laboratory**, training autonomous multi-agent drones using reinforcement learning in simulation environments like AirSim.
- 🚍 **Data Analyst Intern at the MTA**, automating paper-based processes and improving operational workflows using Python and data tools.

🚀 Outside of internships, I'm working on launching a startup — my latest project is **QuickBites**, a campus-focused food delivery app now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quickbites-delivery/id6745470307).

🏀 I also built [**ML March Madness**](https://ml-march-madness-1oj8.vercel.app), a predictive analytics site using ensemble ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to forecast NCAA tournament outcomes.
